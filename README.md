## About a project
One of my first React applications made during the Kodilla WEB DEVELOPER course - dynamic gif search engine. You can enter the phrase you want into search field and the gifs will be downloaded automatically.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
